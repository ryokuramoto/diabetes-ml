# DiabetesML

This project explores Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques using a diabetes diagnosis dataset. The goal is to apply these machine learning methods to a real dataset, evaluate their performance, and effectively visualize the results.

## Files

- **dataset**
  - `diabetes.csv`: The dataset file.
- **scripts**
  - `diabetes_analysis.py`: The Python script containing the analysis and model training code.
  - `diabetes_analysis.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook with the same contents as the Python script.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ryokuramoto/DiabetesML.git
   cd DiabetesML
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:
   - Ensure you have the necessary library installed for this code. You can install them using the requirements.txt file if needed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Running the Python script:
   Execute `diabetes_analysis.py` using your preferred IDE or terminal. Ensure the dataset file is in the same folder as the script.

2. Using the Jupyter Notebook:
   Open `diabetes_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab and run the cells to execute the analysis. Ensure the dataset file is in the same folder as the notebook.
